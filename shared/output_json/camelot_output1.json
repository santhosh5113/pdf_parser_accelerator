                "When do I use passive voice?\nIn some sentences, passive voice can be perfectly acceptable. You might use it in the following cases:\n1.The actor is unknown:\nEg: The cave paintings of Ajanta & Ellora were made in the Upper Old Stone Age.\n[We don’t know who made\nthem.]\n2.The actor is irrelevant:\nEg: An experimental solar nuclear plant will be built in the Australian desert.\n[We are not interested in who is\nbuilding it.]\n3. You are talking about a general truth:\nEg: Rules are made to be broken. [By whomever, whenever.]\n4. You want to emphasize the person or thing acted on. For example, it may be your main topic:\nEg:\nInsulin was first discovered in 1921 by researchers at the University of Toronto.\nIt is still the only treatment\navailable for diabetes.\n5. You are writing in a scientific genre that traditionally relies on passive voice. Passive voice is often preferred\nin\nlab\nreports\nand\nscientific\nresearch\npapers, most\nnotably\nin\nthe Materials\nand Methods\nsection:\nEg: The sodium hydroxide was dissolved in water. This solution was then titrated with hydrochloric acid.",
