Some of these requests relate to sensitive information and data which needs to \n         be protected in order to mitigate risk. \n\n      · Common objectives for data sharing with donors include: (i) situational awareness and \n         programme design; (ii) accountability and transparency; and (iii) legal, regulatory, and policy \n         requirements. \n\n         Common constraints related to sharing data with donors include: (i) lack of regulatory framework \n         for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data; (ii) capacity gaps; and (iii) purpose \n         limitation. \n\n         Donors and humanitarian organizations can take the following steps to minimize risks while \n         maximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: (i) reviewing and clarifying the formal or \n         informal frameworks that govern the collection and sharing of disaggregated data; (ii) formalizing \n         and standardising requests for sensitive data; (iii) investing in data management capacities of \n         staff and organisations; and (iv) adopting common principles for donor data management. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nDonors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data \ncollection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for \naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However, \nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about \nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data \nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity, \nprotection group, etc.).1 \n\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more \nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management \nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help \nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors \nrequest sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests \nfor personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of \nprincipled aid.2 \n1 Because there are well-established and accepted standards and mechanisms for sharing financial information with donors, including a role for external \n audits, requests for financial data are not included in this guidance note. This guidance note deals with sensitive personal and non-personal data. \n2 Roepstorff, K., Faltas, C. and Hövelmann, S., 2020.

What may be initially considered non-personal data3 \ncan allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification \noccurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not \nadequately anonymized. This can result in a violation of data protection, privacy and other human rights \nand can allow for targeting of individuals or groups with violence or other forms of harm.4 \n\nMany donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such \nsensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks \nand benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices, \nas well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of \nSwitzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a \nvirtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue.5 \n\nThis guidance note synthesizes the outcomes of this dialogue and a related desk review.6 It describes the \nchallenges around sharing sensitive data with donors and offers initial recommendations for how donors \nand humanitarian organizations can more effectively navigate this area. \n\nDONOR REQUESTS FOR DATA \n\nDonors regularly request data from their partners in order to fulfil different obligations and objectives. \nThese requests can be either formal or informal. \n\n      Formal requests tend to be included in grant agreements in relation to reporting criteria, and are \n      typically based on legal requirements such as compliance with counter-terrorism laws. Such requests \n      tend to be negotiated at the outset of a partnership or grant agreement, and are usually made in \n      writing and scheduled in advance. \n\n      Informal requests concern information or data that typically fall outside of the normal scope of \n      reporting. These ad-hoc requests often carry implicit value, meaning that while they are not \n      formally required, delivering this supplementary data is deemed beneficial for an organization's \n      ongoing engagement and partnership with a donor. These requests represent a greater dilemma for \n      humanitarian actors. \n\nFew donors have formal data sharing policies or guidelines in place.7 There is also a lack of shared \nunderstanding of terminology and of the objectives and risks around data sharing. There are different \ndefinitions and understanding of data-related risks, leading to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory \npractices around sharing potentially sensitive data with donors in a particular context.8 \n\n3 Non-personal data is defined as data which was initially personal data, but later made anonymous, such as data about the people affected by the \n humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (adapted from Regulation (EU) \n 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the \n European Union). \n4 See the Working Draft OCHA Guidelines for Data Responsibility and the ICRC Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action. \n5 Read more about the virtual dialogue in this Wilton Park Report. \n6 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020.

This allows donors to improve their own programme design and \nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting \nof assistance. \n\nAccountability and transparency \nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable \ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers. \n\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements \nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and \nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases, \ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors \ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds \nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9 Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover anti- \nbribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10 \n\nCONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS \n\nDespite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of \nregulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of \npurpose limitation. \n\nLack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data \nThe sensitivity of personal data is generally well-known and addressed by a variety of policy and regulatory \nframeworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their \ndata remains challenging due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of \nunderstanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gaps increase the risk of \nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to \nsatisfy donors' requests. \n\nCapacity gaps \nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to \nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing \nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations' \nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps \nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding, \nundermining localization efforts.13 \n\n9 See NRC's Toolkit for Principled Humanitarian Action; Managing CT Risks. \n10 In order to ensure compliance, donors might request highly disaggregated data to corroborate their due diligence processes, ensuring their partners \n are not engaging with any 'sanctioned' person or entity'. See Walker, J., 2020. Compliance Dialogue on Syria-Related Humanitarian Payments. \n 'Sanctioned persons' is a general term which may include individuals, terrorist groups, governments as well as companies and other entities of legal \n personality. The EU, for example, has over the years considerably strengthened its legal framework for preventing money laundering and terrorism \n financing in recent years and is constantly enforcing in.

Data used out of context and for \npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined \npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects' rights. \n\n RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n In view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) \n at ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs \n recommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while \n maximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: \n\n     Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and \n     sharing of disaggregated data \n     Donors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal \n     requirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements \n     correctly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the \n     willingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain \n     funding from donors. \n\n   · Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data \n     When sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and \n     standardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify \n     which data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only \n     request the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and \n     should indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document \n     all requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time. \n\n      Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations \n     Donors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data \n     management expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned \n     to encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building. \n\n     Adopting common principles for donor data management \n     The sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of \n     humanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data \n     responsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and \n     guidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led \n     by the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process \n     as part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue. \n\n Organizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the \n Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org. \n\n14 ICRC, 2020.
