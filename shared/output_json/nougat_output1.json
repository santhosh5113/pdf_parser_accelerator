Fowler, F.R.S.--Received November 7th, 1925.)\n\n## 1 Introduction.\n\nIt is well known that the experimental facts of atomic physics necessitate a departure from the classical theory of electrodynamics in the description of atomic phenomena. This departure takes the form, in Bohr's theory, of the special assumptions of the existence of stationary states of an atom, in which it does not radiate, and of certain rules, called quantum conditions, which fix the stationary states and the frequencies of the radiation emitted during transitions between them. These assumptions are quite foreign to the classical theory, but have been very successful in the interpretation of a restricted region of atomic phenomena. The only way in which the classical theory is used is through the assumption that the classical laws hold for the description of the motion in the stationary states, although they fail completely during transitions, and the assumption, called the Correspondence Principle, that the classical theory gives the right results in the limiting case when the action per cycle of the system is large compared to Planck's constant \\(h\\), and in certain other special cases.\n\nIn a recent paper* Heisenberg puts forward a new theory, which suggests that it is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault, but that the mathematical operations by which physical results are deduced from them require modification. _All_ the information supplied by the classical theory can thus be made use of in the new theory.\n\n## 2 Quantum Algebra.\n\nConsider a multiply periodic non-degenerate dynamical system of \\(u\\) degrees of freedom, defined by equations connecting the co-ordinates and their time differential coefficients. We may solve the problem on the classical theory in the following way. Assume that each of the co-ordinates \\(x\\) can be expanded in the form of a multiple Fourier series in the time \\(t\\), thus,\n\n\\[x=\\Sigma_{a_{1}\\ldots\\,a_{n}}x\\left(a_{1}a_{2}\\,\\ldots\\,a_{n}\\right)\\,\\exp.\\ i\\left(a_{1}\\omega_{1}\\dashv a_{2}\\omega_{2} \\dashv\\,\\ldots\\,+a_{n}\\omega_{n}\\right)t\\]\n\n\\[=\\Sigma_{a}x_{a}\\,\\exp.\\ i\\left(a\\,\\omega\\right)t,\\]\n\n* Heisenberg, 'Zeits. f.

There is much stronger evidence than this, however, owing to the fact that the classical operations obey the same laws as the quantum ones, so that if, by applying the quantum operations, one can get an inconsistency, by applying the classical operations in the same way one must also get an inconsistency. If a series of classical operations leads to the equation \\(0\\!=\\!0\\), the corresponding series of quantum operations must also lead to the equation \\(0\\!=\\!0\\), and not to \\(h\\!=\\!0\\), since there is no way of obtaining a quantity that does not vanish by a quantum operation with quantum variables such that the corresponding classical operation with the corresponding classical variables gives a quantity that does vanish.

Fowler, F.R.S.--Received November 7th, 1925.)\n\n## 1 Introduction.\n\nIt is well known that the experimental facts of atomic physics necessitate a departure from the classical theory of electrodynamics in the description of atomic phenomena. This departure takes the form, in Bohr's theory, of the special assumptions of the existence of stationary states of an atom, in which it does not radiate, and of certain rules, called quantum conditions, which fix the stationary states and the frequencies of the radiation emitted during transitions between them. These assumptions are quite foreign to the classical theory, but have been very successful in the interpretation of a restricted region of atomic phenomena. The only way in which the classical theory is used is through the assumption that the classical laws hold for the description of the motion in the stationary states, although they fail completely during transitions, and the assumption, called the Correspondence Principle, that the classical theory gives the right results in the limiting case when the action per cycle of the system is large compared to Planck's constant \\(h\\), and in certain other special cases.\n\nIn a recent paper* Heisenberg puts forward a new theory, which suggests that it is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault, but that the mathematical operations by which physical results are deduced from them require modification. _All_ the information supplied by the classical theory can thus be made use of in the new theory.\n\n## 2 Quantum Algebra.\n\nConsider a multiply periodic non-degenerate dynamical system of \\(u\\) degrees of freedom, defined by equations connecting the co-ordinates and their time differential coefficients.

Substitute these values in the equations of motion, and equate\n‘the coefficients on either side of each harmonic term.

There is much stronger evidence than this, however, owing to the fact that the classical operations obey the same laws as the quantum ones, so that if, by applying the quantum operations, one can get an inconsistency, by applying the classical operations in the same way one must also get an inconsistency. If a series of classical operations leads to the equation \\(0\\!=\\!0\\), the corresponding series of quantum operations must also lead to the equation \\(0\\!=\\!0\\), and not to \\(h\\!=\\!0\\), since there is no way of obtaining a quantity that does not vanish by a quantum operation with quantum variables such that the corresponding classical operation with the corresponding classical variables gives a quantity that does vanish. The possibility mentioned above of deducing by quantum operations the inconsistency \\(h\\!=\\!0\\) thus cannot occur. _The correspondence between the quantum and classical theories lies not so much in the limiting agreement when \\(h\\!\\succ\\!0\\) as in the fact that the mathematical operations on the two theories obey in many cases the same laws_.\n\nFor a system of one degree of freedom, if we take \\(p\\!=\\!m\\dot{q}\\), the only quantum condition is\n\n\\[2\\pi m\\,(q\\,\\dot{q}-\\dot{q}q)=\\dot{n}.\\]\n\nEquating the constant part of the left-hand side to _ih_, we get\n\n\\[4\\pi m\\,\\Sigma_{h}\\,q\\,(nk)\\,q\\,(kn)\\,\\omega\\,(kn)=h.\\]\n\nThis is equivalent to Heisenberg's quantum condition.* By equating the remaining components of the left-hand side to zero we get further relations not given by Heisenberg's theory.\n\nThe quantum conditions (12) get over, in many cases, the difficulties concerning the order in which quantities occurring in products in the equations of motion are to be taken. The order does not matter except when a \\(p_{r}\\) and \\(q\\), are multiplied together, and this never occurs in a system describable by a potential energy function that depends only on the \\(q\\)'s, and a kinetic energy function that depends only on the \\(p\\)'s.\n\nIt may be pointed out that the classical theory quantity occurring in Kramers' and Heisenberg's theory of scattering by atoms+ has components which are of the form (8) (with \\(\\kappa_{r}=\\mathrm{J}_{r}\\)), and which are interpreted on the quantum theory in a manner in agreement with the present theory.
