Donors seek information and data from humanitarian organizationsina order to understand and react to changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and evaluation, prevent duplication of assistance. identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting of assistance. Accountability and transparency Donors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable donors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers. Legal, regulatory, and policy requirements Donors are subject to certain national land internationallegal requirements, including political, legal and statutory requirements related to counter-terorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases, donors might want to use date to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors include counterelorism clauses in their granteements, which are intended to ensure that their funds are not used to benefit designated terroris troups. similarly, donors might include clauses to cover anti- bribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures. le CONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS Despite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managementsnitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of purpose limitation. Lack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data The senitivity of personal data generally well-known and addressed by variety of policy and regulatory frameworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their data remains challengeng due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of understanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gapsincrease therisk of sensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to satisfy donors requests. Caparcity gaps Responding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to humanitarian responders, dverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing activities. Insuificient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations' ability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.'Gaps incapacity to full don'regulrements might also deters maller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,undeminding localization efforts..3*ementy recognities.wiki.companies and other entities offegal Economy have an objection to account for executive money burdening and mentorism Action.
